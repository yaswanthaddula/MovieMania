✅ 8. history.html – Booking History Page (Final Version)
🔥 Firebase Setup:
Booking data is read from the Firestore collection:

Collection: bookings
Document: [user's email]
Field: history (Array of booking objects)
👉 Ticket cancellation will update the array by removing the selected booking.

📂 Path:
/public/history.html

🔍 Purpose:
Display user's full booking history with options to:
View the full ticket (in ticket.html)
Cancel any booking (removes from Firestore)

📄 What This Page Should Have:
👤 Welcome message (with user’s email or name)

📜 Booking list (each with):
🎬 Movie Name
🏟️ Theater
🗓️ Date
🪑 Seats
💰 Amount Paid
💳 Payment Method
🔘 Buttons:

✅ View Ticket → goes to ticket.html

🎨 Linked Files:

These are already in your repository.
⚙️ JavaScript Behavior (history.js):
Uses Firebase Auth to get the current user
Fetches bookings/{user.email} document
Loops through history[] array to display each booking

On "View Ticket":

Saves clicked booking to localStorage as selectedTicket

Redirects to ticket.html

Updates the Firestore document with the new history[]

💡 Developer Notes:
Use JSON.stringify(booking) to store the full object
Use .filter() to remove the selected booking from array
Confirm before cancellation with a popup (confirm())
